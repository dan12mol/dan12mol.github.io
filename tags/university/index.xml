&lt;p&gt;The last time I left you off with the slight impression that my dreams about university being the place where I&amp;rsquo;d get to write quality code and learn how to develop actual applications and boost my career start wasn&amp;rsquo;t really as expected. That is entirely correct. In fact, at the time of this writing I&amp;rsquo;m in my 8th, and final, semester of university and I still have the strong belief that we we&amp;rsquo;re taught a load of crap. But even though the introduction has mentioned most of it, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the process of explaining it all more in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first semester of university was a mix between learning what I had already been taught in high-school, which is functional programming, and learning some basics of hardware programming. I can say the hardware programming part was quite fun as we had a great teacher. Apart from one professor here and there who utterly sucked at their own curricula, I must admit I liked the first semester, this was however sheer luck as I would soon find out most of the professor I would have in the future would be in the lower-end of the food chain.
By the time I reached my third semester we had began studying OOP in Java, as well as deepening our C/C++ knowledge. Some of my colleagues have started getting jobs at different companies and I was getting the feeling that this was what I was supposed to do as well. Not lingering much longer, I send my resume to a couple of companies hoping to get a job and start chipping in some money for myself. I had gotten two interviews. One was at a big corporate companies that we&amp;rsquo;re designing software for german cars like BMW, Porsche, VW and so on. The interview consisted of a technical side where a lady asked me a couple of OOP questions like &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s an abstract class in Java?&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a constructor?&amp;rsquo;. Later on I would find out these sort of questions are not a joke, but an actual technical interview at corporate companies, the sort of which I had learned to avoid. Following this was a language interview where a lady started talking german to me to see if I can speak he language fluently (which I nailed since I had studied 8 grades with german as mother-tongue). They sent me home quickly with a promise that I would be getting a feedback on my interview as soon as possible. This of course never happened. The other interview was at a small company who we&amp;rsquo;re developing in Ruby on Rails. I had no prior knowledge on Rails so I went there blindfolded. The interview here consisted of a test (around 1h) of logical questions with a small code task at the end. We we&amp;rsquo;re 7 people total at the interview, the others we&amp;rsquo;re older than me so I can safely say I had the disadvantage of not knowing as much stuff as they did. Nevertheless, the others got sent home immediately afterwards, while I was called in to speak with a developer for another interview. We sat on a couch for about 15 minutes and spoke about what my intentions were and what I had done so far programming-wise. The reply came a few weeks afterwards stating they had thoroughly analysed my case and decided I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough experience and that if I should decide to still need a job in a few years, we should keep in touch. This also never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a bit more, after the fourth semester I went abroad in Denmark for 6 weeks of summer school. This is something that my mom insisted for me to do and it turned out to be a wise decision indeed. I had opted for two courses: a 4 week course on web development and a 2 week course on developing Android apps. The best experience I got in summer school was meeting a bunch of cool people and seeing the differences between people with different nationalities. Nevertheless, let&amp;rsquo;s keep it professional. The web development course was taught by two guys which together had a web development company. One was a dev, the other a designer. The fact that this was 2012 and I was taught how to develop web apps using Microsoft Visual Studio and Flash was not a surprise for me at the time. Looking back I can see that they we&amp;rsquo;re old-school (should&amp;rsquo;ve been hinted by the fact that they we&amp;rsquo;re using IE as their default browser, before IE got big improvements). The Android course was taught by a young fellow who was CEO at a mobile app development company. I can say he was a pretty cool guy and we definitely learned a lot of stuff over the course of 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the ending of the fifth semester I had already known more programming languages like LISP, PHP, HTML ,CSS, ML, Haskell, Prolog, Assembly and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d take another shot at joining the company. Most of my colleagues already got a job by this time (I believe we we&amp;rsquo;re ~150 and around ~100 we&amp;rsquo;re employed). I was hinted that the company that we&amp;rsquo;re doing IT Consulting for Porsche we&amp;rsquo;re coming to my city so I decided to send them a resume. They replied shortly stating that a resume in English wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough and that I should send one in German, and a recommendation letter as well. I quickly translated my resume and got a recommendation letter from one of my professors in Denmark and sent them over. After a few talks over e-mails I was invited for an interview at their HQ. Here I saw a different kind of interview. Rather then being asked questions about what I know and what my plans for the future are, they presented my with what they had to offer for me to join the company. Soon afterwards I was given a task which consisted in some theoretical questions about SAP and a small practical task of writing some Java code. I had two weeks to accomplish this. Two days later I had finished it and sent it over. The reply never came back. I had sent 3 e-mails over the course of the next few months asking what is happening and until today they had never replied but they still send me e-mails wishing me happy birthday every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014 we had to do 6 weeks worth of work at a company as a school assignment. I applied to numerous companies and got a few interviews but I only attended two of those. One was at the company I was back in 2012 (the one making car software, the one that never replied me with my interview feedback). I was scheduled for an interview about my resume and then another interview consisting of 10 short technical questions soon afterwards. They said yes. However I did not join that company. The other interview was over Skype, with a small company (~8 employees) in another city. The fact that I was to work remote attracted me and I decided to join. They we&amp;rsquo;re doing web development. And so, my career had started..&lt;/p&gt;
